        <h2>the story for Caramel</h2>
        <p>I decided to open Caramel Cafe one sunny morning while sipping on a rich caramel latte. 
        As the warm, velvety notes of caramel enveloped my senses, a simple thought crossed my mind - why not share this delightful experience with the world? The idea of creating a cozy space where people could escape from their busy lives and savor the simple pleasure of caramel-flavored delights inspired me to turn that dream into reality.
        And so, Caramel Cafe was born, a place where sweetness and comfort come together to create unforgettable moments.</p>
